EPIDEMICA

ALL VALUES ARE ARBITRARY

Select one of 4 diseases-> each is strong in certain regions (if we cannot model real world diseases through use of SIR model/PDEs, create your own diseases!)
1. Anthrax
2. Cholera
3. Tuberculosis
4. Bubonic Plague

Choose a region; base colonization rate= 5 units (+- 1 based on choice vis a vis susceptibility)

There are 6 continents, each with 6 biomes:

      - Coasts: Indian Peninsula
      - Islands: Indonesian Archipelago
  2. Africa
      - Plains: Serengeti and Okavango Deltas
      - Mountains: Kilimanjaro
      - Forests: Congo Rainforest
      - Deserts, Plateaux, and Mesas: Sahara
      - Coasts: Bight of Benin, Horn of Africa, Gulf of Africa
      - Islands: Madagascar
  3. South America
      - Plains: Pampas, Pantanal
      - Mountains: Andes
      - Forests: Amazon
      - Deserts, Plateaux, and Mesas: Atacama
      - Coasts: Humboldt Current Region
      - Islands: Galapagos, Easter and Falkland
  4. North America
      - Plains: Prairie
      - Mountains: Rockies
      - Forests: Central American Rainforest
      - Deserts, Plateaux, and Mesas: Mojave
      - Coasts: Western and Eastern Seaboard
      - Islands: Aleutians, Hawaii, Caribbean
  5. Oceania
      - Plains: Canterbury
      - Mountains: South Alps
      - Forests: Papua New Guinea
      - Deserts, Plateaux, and Mesas: Great Victoria Desert
      - Coasts: Great Barrier Reef
      - Islands: South Pacific
  6. Europe
      - Plains: Steppes
      - Mountains: Alps
      - Forests: Taiga
      - Deserts, Plateaux, and Mesas: Scandinavia
      - Coasts: Baltic Coast
      - Islands: Greenland, Spanish Islands
  
Which Biome is weak to what disease?
1. Plains: weak to Anthrax, Bubonic Plague; resistant to Tuberculosis
2. Mountains: weak to Tuberculosis, Anthrax; resistant to Cholera 
3. Forests: weak to Tuberculosis, Bubonic Plague; resistant to Anthrax
4. DPM: weak to Bubonic Plague, Cholera; resistant to Anthrax
5. Coasts: weak to Cholera, Anthrax; resistant to Bubonic Plague
6. Islands: weak to Cholera, Tuberculosis; resistant to Bubonic Plague

Base Eradication Rate: 50 turns

Every [3,8] turns, you are given a random mutation (from choices 1 to 9)
Favoured Spread: Base Colonization Rate=4
Impeded Spread: Base Colonization Rate=6
Strain Evolution: Eradication rate increases by [5,15]
Strain Extinction: Eradication rate decreases by [1,5]
Severe Symptoms: Mutation rate becomes [2,7]
Weak Symptoms: Mutation rate becomes [4, 9]
Antibiotic Resistance: Every time a mutation is given, the eradication rate increases by 10% BUT Strain Evolution Mutation makes eradication rate by only [2, 12]
Medical R&D: Every time a mutation is given, the eradication rate decreases by 10% BUT Strain Evolution Mutation makes eradication rate to [7, 17]
Colonization: Spread to a new continent apart from the ones you are already in

Now, the list of continental bonuses- what benefit do you get for starting on a continent? (This bonus remains constant throughout the game; does not change when you shift continents)
1. Africa: At the beginning of the game, there is a  15% chance that the BCR will decrease by 1.
2. Asia: At each mutation, there is a 25% chance that you will get an extra mutation.
3. Europe (Challenge Mode): BER decreases by 5 each time you receive a mutation.
4. Oceania: At the beginning of the game, there is a 15% chance that all biome resistances are neglected.
5. North America: At each colonization of a new biome, there is a 5% chance that you will colonize another region. 
6. South America: If BER becomes zero, there is a 25% chance that you will be revived ONCE with a BER of 10.

If you cover all regions you win; Else if you get eradicated you are dead.

Finally, output the number of countries conquered and display pre-coded compliments based on how many that is. (Good job, you read this whole thing!)

Conditionals:
If more than 20 biomes are covered, the tempo of the game changes.
1. BER decreases by either 1 or 2 every time: increased medical research efforts and quarantine may cause the faster death of the disease
2. BMR range increases by 2 to [lowerbound-1, upperbound+1]: More variability as selection pressure causes genetic variation and dissimilarity of strains
3. BCR increases by 1: lockdown on borders and quarantine of the infected stymies spread

If more than 30 biomes are covered:
1. BER decreases by 2 or 3 every turn
2. BMR range increases to [lowerbound-2, upperbound+2]
3. BCR + 2


10/10
Need to develop continental bonuses, conditional bitebacks, and improve flavour text.
